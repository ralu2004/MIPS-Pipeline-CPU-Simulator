\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Context}
The aim of this project is to develop an educational CPU simulation software that mimics the 5-stage MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) pipeline based on the 32-bit MIPS Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).

The simulator will visualize the flow of instruction through the MIPS pipeline, detect and display hazards, and help users understand the dynamics of parallel execution inside a CPU through a graphical user interface.

\subsection{Objectives}
The application's execution engine will be implemented in Java, while the user interface will be developed using the Next.js web framework, following the principles of software engineering for maintainability and scalability. The graphical user interface will model the 5 pipeline stages (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB) interactively, showcasing the functional simulation of at least 15 MIPS instructions (R, I, and J types). In addition to the pipeline stages, the registers, memory, flag information (branch/jump), arithmetic logic unit operation codes, and register file contents will be displayed during the simulation. The user will be able to run their own sequence of instructions or choose from a few available test programs.

\section{Bibliographic Research}
\subsection{Importance of CPU Pipelining}
The performance of a processor depends on factors such as clock speed, critical path length, and cycles per instruction (CPI). A single-cycle CPU executes one instruction per clock cycle, making the design simple but inefficient because not all instructions take the same amount of time. Pipelining addresses this limitation by allowing multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously at different stages. The pipeline architecture is designed for throughput, increasing CPU performance, but introduces hazards - structural, data, and control hazards - that must be detected and resolved for correctness.

\subsection{MIPS Architecture and Pipelining}
The MIPS Architecture is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) design. Its pipeline implementation consists of 5 execution stages, Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, Execute, Memory, and Write Back, which enable the parallel processing of multiple instructions. 

In a software simulator, true parallel execution is not possible; however, an event-based software architecture can create the illusion of concurrency while preserving accuracy in time and hazard detection.

\subsection{Existing Tools}
Several existing simulators such as MARS \cite{mars} and SPIM \cite{spim} are widely used to run MIPS assembly code. However, they do not provide a detailed visualization of pipeline execution.

This project aims to provide a slightly different perspective by creating an interactive, educational simulator that focuses on how instructions move through the pipeline and how hazards affect performance.

\subsection{Software Design Considerations}
The simulator will follow object-oriented design principles such as modularity, encapsulation, and separation of concerns. The architecture will clearly separate:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the execution engine (responsible for instruction handling and pipeline state),
    \item the data model (registers, memory, instructions), and
    \item the user interface layer (for visualization and user interaction).
\end{itemize}
